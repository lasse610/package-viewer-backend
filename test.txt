Description: thorough real-mode memory tester
 Memtest86+ scans your RAM for errors.
 .
 This tester runs independently of any OS - it is run at computer
 boot-up, so that it can test *all* of your memory.  You may want to
 look at `memtester', which allows to test your memory within Linux,
 but this one won't be able to test your whole RAM.
 .
 It can output a list of bad RAM regions usable by the BadRAM kernel
 patch, so that you can still use your old RAM with one or two bad bits.
 .
 Memtest86+ is based on memtest86 3.0, and adds support for recent
 hardware, as well as a number of general-purpose improvements,
 including many patches to memtest86 available from various sources.
 .
 Both memtest86 and memtest86+ are being worked on in parallel.

Description: XML formatter driven by XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO.)
 FOP is a Java application that reads a formatting object tree and then
 turns it into a wide variety of output presentations (including AFP,
 PCL, PDF, PNG, PostScript, RTF, TIFF, and plain text), or displays
 the result on-screen.
 .
 The formatting object tree can be in the form of an XML document
 (output by an XSLT engine like xalan) or can be passed in memory as a
 DOM Document or (in the case of xalan) SAX events.
 .
 This package contains the fop command line tool
