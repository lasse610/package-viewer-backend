Description: Package Discovery and Resource Access using pkg_resources
 The pkg_resources module provides an API for Python libraries to
 access their resource files, and for extensible applications and
 frameworks to automatically discover plugins.  It also provides
 runtime support for using C extensions that are inside zipfile-format
 eggs, support for merging packages that have separately-distributed
 modules or subpackages, and APIs for managing Python's current
 "working set" of active packages.

Description: Wietse Venema's TCP wrapper utilities
 Wietse Venema's network logger, also known as TCPD or LOG_TCP.
 .
 These programs log the client host name of incoming telnet,
 ftp, rsh, rlogin, finger etc. requests.
 .
 Security options are:
  - access control per host, domain and/or service;
  - detection of host name spoofing or host address spoofing;
  - booby traps to implement an early-warning system.

Description: Bean Scripting Framework to support scripting languages in Java
 Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
 scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java
 objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write JSPs in
 languages other than Java while providing access to the Java class library. In
 addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in part (or
 dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. This is
 achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language engines
 from within Java, as well as an object registry that exposes Java objects to
 these scripting language engines.
 .
 BSF supports these scripting languages:
  * Python (using Jython)
  * JavaScript (using rhino)
  * XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and Xerces)
  * BeanShell (using bsh) via its own bsf adapter
 .
 Support for Tcl, NetRexx is not available in this Debian
 package since Jacl, NetRexx (non-free) are not packaged.

Description: aspect-oriented extension for Java - library
 AspectJ enables the clean modularization of crosscutting concerns
 such as: error checking and handling, synchronization, context-sensitive
 behavior, performance optimizations, monitoring and logging, debugging
 support, multi-object protocols.

Description: Simple Logging Facade for Java
 The Simple Logging Facade for Java (or SLF4J) is intended to serve as
 a simple facade for various logging APIs allowing to the end-user to
 plug in the desired implementation at deployment time. SLF4J also
 allows for a gradual migration path away from Apache Commons
 Logging (CL)
 .
 Logging API implementations can either choose to implement the SLF4J
 interfaces directly, e.g. logback or SimpleLogger. Alternatively, it
 is possible (and rather easy) to write SLF4J adapters for the given
 API implementation, e.g. Log4jLoggerAdapter or JDK14LoggerAdapter.
